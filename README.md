# Connected-Components-Labeling
Implementations of connected component labeling algorithms for binary images. Currently, there are two algorithms implemented - 
recursive and union-find. Both of these implementations are based on the pseudocode described in Shapiro and Stockton's Computer Vision
 text. To ensure contiguous labels in the union-find implementation, there is one additional post-processing step.
 
 Some example outputs can be seen below.
 
 ## How to Run
 
 ```
python -l union IMAGE1 IMAGE2 IMAGE3
python -l recursive IMAGE1 IMAGE2
python --labeler union IMAGE1
python --labeler recursive IMAGE1
```
 
 Default labeler is `union`, and default images are the images in `test_data` directory.

## Notes
I believe there are a few bugs in these implementations which need to be addressed - will need to revisit.
